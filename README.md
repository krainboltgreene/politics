Politics!
=========

Politics is a simple political simulation game for 1 to 4 players who want to really hate each other.


Goal
----

In Politics the goal is to stay at the highest level of power for the longest possible number of turns.
Each year in power grants you a certain number of points based on the office you held.

> Note: There are no points for enacting good laws or policies.

Here's the point system for each office:

  - **President**: 50/Term, 10 Years maximum (2 Terms, 100pts)
  - **Vice President**: 40/Term, as long as the President is in office (2 Terms, 80pts)
  - **Speaker Of The States**: 20/Term, 12 Years maximum (3 Terms, 60pts)
  - **Speaker Of The People**: 2 points per year, 20 Years Maximum

The President and VP "enjoy" 5 Years/Term while the State and People have 4 Years/Term.
The longer you are in office the more points you receive.
If someone (including a computer AI) beats you in the race then you lose.
The game ends when any player gets **100 points or all players have been beaten by AI**.
Here are the ways you can win:

  - Be President for the full 10 years (Vice Presidents never win this way)
  - Stay in office as the People Speaker for a full 20 years and then State Speaker for 12.
  - Ride on the coat tails of the President as the VP, get him impeached, get elected.
